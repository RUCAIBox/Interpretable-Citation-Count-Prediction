# Interpretable-Citation-Count-Prediction
This repository contains the dataset and the source code for the TOIS paper "Interpretable Aspect-aware Capsule Network for Peer Review based Citation Count Prediction"[1].

## Introduction
Nowadays, the number of research papers increases in an unprecedented growth rate. How to quickly identify important and influential ones from a large corpus of research papers? One of the useful criteria is the citation count, which indicates how many other research papers have cited this one. In order to estimate the potential impact of a paper at its early stage, the task of citation count prediction emerges, which aims to predict a paperâ€™s citation count once the paper is published. The aforementioned existing methods neglect another important information for citation count prediction: the information generated during the peer review process. The authors of research papers tend to discuss their advantages and claim contributions, while ignoring the shortcomings of their own work. Thus it is necessary to adopt the review text as the complementary information for citation count prediction. To address the need for predicting citation count based on peer reviews, we present this dataset and propose a novel aspect-aware capsule network.
